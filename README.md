## Broad Overview

Long term goal tracking software, with facebook abilities, and a backbone.js front end that makes it feel smoother than others. Still very much alpha, and not yet released.

## Why make this?

My life to do list is one of my most powerful tools to combat malaise, and envite what I want into my life. Somehow just having the clarity of knowing that I've thought about what I want makes me happier, and more productive. It could be on a napkin, but, I think this is slightly better.

For a long time I've kept my long term life to-do items in a program on my computer. This was great, but it was lacking in a couple of areas. The first key feature was to be able to share it with friends. The second was that the goals shouldn't simply disappear once accomplished, they should stick around.

There are other great apps out ther for [managing the day to day](http://lift.do) things, but I wanted something that was meant for the lifetime. 

There are other apps out there, but somehow, they weren't quite what I was looking for.

## API, There Is One
But there's no documentation on it yet. The front end is built on backbone, then backend on rails. The point of this is mostly that you can use whatever of your own data, wherever you want on the internet. At some point soon, all accounts will have API keys, allowing them to retrieve JSON.

This was one of the main reasons I felt we needed a new bucket list app. I don't want my life goals to be just listed on someone else's site. I wnant ot be able to embed them wherever. 

## Support
